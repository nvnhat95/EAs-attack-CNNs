# EAs-attack-CNNs
perform adversarial attacks on CNNs using Evolutionary Algorithms
This project includes 2 different types of attacking:
  - all pixel attack: perform on inception-v3 integrated in keras with ImageNet 2012 dataset. Attack methods: GA and LS-CMA-ES which is a novel method allowing the use of CMA-ES in high dimentional spaces
  - 1 pixel (or several pixels) attack: perform on a resnet model with CIFAR-10 dataset. Attack methods: GA, CMA-ES and DE
